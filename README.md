# LeetCode Solutions & Revision Tracker

Solutions to LeetCode problems (mostly in [add your language, e.g. Python / Java / C++]).  
Goal: Solve → Understand → Revise 3–5 times → Master for interviews.

**Current stats** (as of Feb 20, 2026):  
- Problems solved: **8**  
- Problems revised at least once: **0** (update as you revise!)  
- Target: Revise most problems **3–5 times** with spaced repetition

### Revision Tracking Guide
Each row has **5 checkboxes** representing revision sessions:  
- ☐ = not revised yet  
- ☑ = revised (mark one more ☑ each time you revise)  
Example: ☑ ☑ ☐ ☐ ☐ → revised twice

Update the table after every revision session or new solve.  
Tip: Revisit problems after 1 day → 1 week → 1 month → etc.

### Next Goals
- Complete **Blind 75** / **NeetCode 150**  
- Focus more on **Backtracking** (you already have several — revise them heavily)  
- Add solutions consistently with clean code + comments + time/space complexity  
- Start adding revision dates or notes if needed (optional extra column)

Feel free to add new rows as you solve more problems.  
Happy grinding! 💪🚀
